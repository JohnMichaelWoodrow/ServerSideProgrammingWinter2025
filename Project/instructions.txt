Important Note About Player Ship Tracking and Server Attacks

- The game does not store or validate your ship locations.
- You must remember where your ships are.

- When the server takes a turn and attacks your board:
  - A red cell appears to show the guess.
  - If that guess hits one of your ships, you must manually mark it by selecting hit.
  - If it's a miss, select miss.

- The game does not automatically check whether the server hit or missed your ships.
- This game runs on an honor system for the playerâ€™s side.

Game Logic Overview (from battleshipEngine.js)

- The game uses two 10x10 grids (player and server).
- Ships are tracked as lists of coordinates on the server side only.

- Attacks:
  - Server checks if selected coordinates hit its own ships.
  - If a ship has all its cells hit, it is marked as sunk.

- Victory Condition:
  - The game ends when one side has no ships left.

- Server Endpoints:
  - /new          - Starts a new game
  - /hit?x=3&y=5  - Sends an attack to cell (3,5)
  - /status       - Returns current game state
  - /reset        - Resets the board
  - /concede      - Player forfeits the game
